Hi! I have made a  simple Weather Checking App with API.
This mini project will help you to in the following ways:
1)  Gaining a good knowledge about Web Development including HTML,CSS,JS.
2)  The use of API key for connecting to the server.

   I hope the project will help the beginners.
   LOOKING FORWARD TO UPLOAD MORE AMAZING PROJECTS.
